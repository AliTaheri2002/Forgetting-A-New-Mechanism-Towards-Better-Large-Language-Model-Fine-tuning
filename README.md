### Brief Introduction

This project investigates a novel forgetting mechanism for supervised fine-tuning of large language models. Our method categorizes tokens into positive and negative sets based on influence scores, then learns from positive tokens while actively forgetting negative tokens. This approach maintains full dataset scale while establishing clearer knowledge boundaries, leading to improved generalization and performance across multiple benchmarks.

## Overview

Traditional supervised fine-tuning approaches either use all data uniformly (potentially learning from noise) or discard low-quality samples (reducing dataset scale). Our FORGETTING mechanism addresses this by:

1. **Reference Model Fine-tuning**: Train a reference model on a subset of data
2. **Token Quality Assessment**: Calculate influence scores for each token
3. **Token Selection**: Partition tokens into positive and negative sets
4. **Training with Forgetting**: Train using dual objective with adaptive coefficient

## Usage

### Model Selection
Edit `run_pipeline.sh` to select your base model:

```bash
# Base models - uncomment one:
# base_model="meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B"    # 1B model
# base_model="meta-llama/Llama-3.2-3B"    # 3B model
base_model="meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B"      # 8B model
```

### Training
Run the complete pipeline:

```bash
bash run_pipeline.sh
```

### Evaluation
Evaluate the trained model:

```bash
bash run_evaluation.sh <model_size>
```

## Results

Performance improvements over standard SFT:

| Model | Standard SFT | Forgetting (Ours) | Improvement |
|-------|--------------|-------------------|-------------|
| LLaMA-3.2-1B | 30.37% | 34.86% | +4.49% |
| LLaMA-3.2-3B | 46.90% | 52.18% | +5.28% |
| LLaMA-3.1-8B | 51.02% | 59.27% | +8.25% |
